# ðŸ§  Modular Machine Learning Pipeline

This repository contains a **modular machine learning pipeline** built with Python and scikit-learn.  
It supports dataset loading, preprocessing, training multiple models, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and feature importance visualization.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Load default **Titanic dataset** or custom CSV dataset.
- Preprocess data (handle missing values, encoding, scaling).
- Train multiple models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
- Hyperparameter tuning using **GridSearchCV**.
- Evaluate models with:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - Classification Report
  - Confusion Matrix (heatmap)
- Plot **Feature Importance** (for tree-based models).
- Save best models as `.pkl` files using **joblib**.
